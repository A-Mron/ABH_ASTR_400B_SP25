% Abstract of the paper
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The Topic}
The kinetic evolution of the Dark matter halo after a major merger is described by how objects in the halo move and how that movement changes through the merging process. The Dark matter halo is a galaxy region that stretches out far beyond the galaxy. This region is dominated by non-visible dark matter as the name suggests and is crucial to maintaining the galaxies internal structure. In galaxy mergers the halo governs over the orbital dynamics and is what drives the eventual combining into one singular galaxy remanent.  
\subsection{Why it Matters}
\textbf{Galaxies} are defined as a gravitationally bound set of stars whose properties can not by a combination of baryons and Newtons Laws of gravity \cite{Willman_Strader2012}. One aspect of galaxies are the satellites that orbit around them. \textbf{Satellite Galaxies} are smaller galaxies that are bound to a larger galaxy like how the moon is bound to Earth. These satellites accompany the larger galaxies through out it's life span but if the larger galaxy experiences a major merger, the satellites bound state is as risk. A \textbf{Major Merger} is an event where two large galaxies collide and become one. Major mergers change the Kinematics of the two galaxies and thus change the kinematics for the satellites that they bring with them. In the aftermath of mergers satellites have a chance to be ejected from the galaxy by having the necessary velocity to escape a bound orbit. This processes is a contributor to the missing satellites problem. The \textbf{Missing Satellites Problem} is a phenomenon that occurs when there is a discrepancy between the theoretical number of expected galaxies and the observed amount. Understanding the Kinematic change after a merger and if satellites commonly get kicked out of orbit is imperative so that this processes can be accounted for to make more accrete future simulations. 

\subsection{Current Understanding}
From modern simulations galactic mergers cause extended mass distributions for the final merger and an increased central density \citep[e.g.][]{Drakos2019bMNRAS} as seen in Fig\ref{fig:fig 1}.  This extension changes the inner kinematics of the newly merged galaxy and as time progresses the kinematics will 'stabilize' and form a new system of movement for stars and new dark matter and stellar mass distributions. This change in kinematic affects gas as well, during the merger gas clouds of both galaxies can merges and create \textbf{Starburst} regions, which are areas of significant star formation \citep[e.g.][]{Ejdetjärn2025}.

    \label{fig:fig 1}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Open Questions}
Although M31 and the MW are the two giants in focus, the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) is a satellite galaxy of M31 and it will be subject to the kinematics of the merger of M31 and MW. This poses the question, will M33 be bound to the galaxy for will it have the velocity to escape the pull off from the merger?. Other questions include, 'How does the assembly of a central galaxy affect the mass profile and shape of the dark matter halo?' \cite{Abadi2010MNRAS}, 'How do mergers effect galaxy characteristics like gas kinematics and star formation history?' \cite{Ejdetjärn2025}, and 'How are the structural properties of the dark matter halo related to it's growth history?' \cite{Drakos2019aMNRAS}.

\section{This Project}

\subsection{My Project}
\label{sec:My Project}
In this paper we will look at the kinematics of the merger remanent of M31 and the Milky Way to determine if the satellite galaxy M33 is bound or unbounded to the remanent. I will look to answer the questions, \textit{What is the escape speed of the remnant as a function of radius} and \textit{How does the escape velocity vary when computed treating the Dark Matter Halo as a point mass vs fitting a Hernquist profile and using analytic potential}.

This project tackles the open question \textit{will M33 be bound to the galaxy for will it have the velocity to escape the pull off from the merger}? This answer to this question will shed light on the missing satellites problem and is potency in major mergers. If M33 is kicked from the galaxy after the merger then we can infer that galaxy mergers could be one explanation for the difference in expected vs observed satellites. 


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:Mothodology}
\subsection{The Approach}
This project uses data files from the N-body simulations form \cite{vanderMarel2012ApJ}. The simulation form is paper predicts the dynamics of bulge,disk,and halo particles of M33 and the Milky Way. The data used comes from specified "snapshots" in the simulation which are files with particle position and velocity at a specified time that correlated to the "snap number". The N-body simulation is a computer program that simulated the moment and interactions of N number of particles/bodies. 

By the end of this project I will have obtained two equations for the escape velocity as a function of radius. One being the well known:
\begin{equation}
    v_{esc}(R) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \label{EQ1}
\end{equation}
And the other will be calculated using the potential of the at each given radius which will take the form of:
\begin{equation}
    v_{esc}(R) = \sqrt{2|\Phi|} \label{EQ2}
\end{equation}

The potential $(\Phi)$ will consist of three components, one from the bulge, one from the disk, and one from the Halo. The potentials from the Bulge and Disk will be calculated using EQ\ref{EQ1} with their masses being treated as point masses, but the Halo mass will be calculated by fitting a Hernquist profile to the merged dark matter profiles of MW and M31. The Hernquist profile is designed to proximate the distribution of mass in galaxies as mentioned in \cite{Hernquist1990ApJ}.  When the Hernquist profile is fitted it will give the mass (M) and scale length (a) that is needed for the potential equation:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi(R) = \frac{-GM}{(R+a)}
    \label{EQ3}
\end{equation}
The scale length will be determined by plotting the mass profile like in the 5th homework. The Halo masses of M31 and the MW will be concatenated into one array and a Hernquist profile will be overlaid until a scale radius (a) is found that best fits the halo mass. After a scale radius has been determined the potentials of the halo,disk,and bulge will be summed together and used in EQ\ref{EQ2}.

    \label{fig:fig 2}
\end{figure}
I will combine codes from previous homework and labs with two new codes that will be written just for this project. I will use the Homework 2,3,and 5 codes which are the Python scripts that read data files, sum the total mass of components, and fit a Hernquist profile respectively. I will also use code from Lab 4 for the Hernquist profile. The first new script will be a code that takes the total mass of the merged MW and M31 galaxies and plots $v_{esc}$ vs radius and the other that plots $v_{esc,Hernquist}$ vs radius. Both codes will use all three particle types but the disk and bulge (types 2 and 3) will only be used to calculate the total mass of the disk and bulge. Type 1 particles (Halo) will be the type that has a Hernquist profile fitted to. I will use a snapshot after M31 and the MW merge and a clear remanent is determined. Snapshot 650 from the low resolution will be an ideal choice because it will be long after the merger of the two galaxies and the dark mater halo will have stabilized. Low resolution snapshots are also ideal as they contain the necessary mass values while not containing unnecessary data on individual particles. A stabilized halo is required for the study of its kinematics. The snapshot will be obtained form the simulation by \citep[][]{vanderMarel2012ApJ} of the merger of M31 and the Milky Way. 
I will also draw a comparison between the two and see just how much the point mass assumption varies from a more accurate/thought out approach like method\ref{EQ2}. A third plot of the two escape velocities against each other will show how far off they are from each other. If the two are similar or approximately the same the plot should be a linear plot with a slope of ~1.   
\subsection{Hypothesis}
\label{sec:Hypothesis}
Before any computation we can already tell that method 2 (\ref{EQ2}) will be a more accurate conclusion than method 1 (\ref{EQ1}) since method 1 assumes all the mass is concentrated at a single point. This is an incorrect assumption as Dark matter halos can stretch out far beyond the disk and bulge as seen in Fig\ref{fig:fig 2}. The expectation is that the plot of method one will resemble a function of the form:
\begin{equation}
    y(x) = \frac{C}{\sqrt{x}}
    \label{EQ4}
\end{equation}
Where C is some constant that will be determined during computation. Method 2 will be more accurate since it will take into consideration the change in enclosed mass as we move further out into the halo. 
The expectation of the plot of \ref{EQ1}vs\ref{EQ2} is that the slope will either not be linear or the slope will not be ~1. The trend of the plotted line will show the discrepancies of the simplification approach.

For M33 we expect the satellite to remain bounded to the system. With the amount a mass that will be in this new merged galaxy the necessary velocity for escape will be astronomically high and very difficult for M33 to reach. 

\section{Results}
By plotting the Hernquist mass profile with a scale radius of $a=85$ and comparing to the remanent halo mass as a function of radius we get the plot \ref{fig:fig 3}:
\begin{figure}
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{M_profile.png}
    \caption{The x and y axis are radius away from the galactic COM and the mass enclosed   respectively. The dashed line is the Halo mass from snapshot 650 and the solid red line is the estimated Hernquist halo mass profile.}
    \label{fig:fig 3}
\end{figure}

By using the scale radius of 85 from the mass profile plot we first assume a point-mass approximation, and we revive the plot \ref{fig:fig 4}.
\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{EV_Point.png}
    \caption{The x and y axis are radius away from the galactic COM and the escape speed as a function of distance respectively. As we can see the highest achievable escape speed is achieved very close to the COM and is around $v_{esc}\approx 6*10^{11} \frac{km}{s}$.}
    \label{fig:fig 4}
\end{figure}
This plot has the form of a $y=\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ plot. The plot was made by summing the mass of the halo, disk, and bulge into one value and plugging that mass into the escape velocity equation \ref{EQ1}. The escape velocity appears to approach zero very quickly and is very close to 0 around $r=1-2$. One major observation is that the y-axis is on the scaling of $10^{11}$ so the plot going to $0\frac{km}{s}$ at around 2 kilo-parsecs is visually misleading. 

\begin{figure}
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{EV_Hern.png}
    \caption{The x and y axis are radius away from the galactic COM and the escape speed as a function of distance respectively. As we can see the highest achievable escape speed is achieved very close to the COM and is around $v_{esc}\approx 1.4*10^{11} \frac{km}{s}$.}
    \label{fig:fig 5}
\end{figure}
When the Hernquist mass profile is taken into consideration one receives plot \ref{fig:fig 5}. This plot has a similar form to \ref{fig:fig 4} however the magnitude of the y-axis is smaller. The key difference here is that the mass of the halo is not taken as a pint mass and is treated as a function of radius as explained in the methodology section. 

\textbf{Need help with last part of code regarding M33 and if it is bound, will be in office hours Thursday to address it}

\textit{Paragraph about M33 and where it falls on the plots will be here}

\section{Conclusion}
From plots \ref{fig:fig 4} and \ref{fig:fig 5} we can see that the point mass escape velocity, $v_{point}$ is larger then the Hernquist escape velocity $v_{Hern}$ along the entirety of the radial distance outwards. By taking the apparent maximum velocities from the plots we see:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{v_{point}}{v_{hern}} = \frac{6*10^{11}}{1.4*10^{11}} \approx 4.3
\end{equation}
From this we can infer that on average the point mass approximation velocities are around 4.3 times as larger then that of the Hernquist velocity. This means that in the point mass approximation it is much harder for something to escape the galaxy remanent. The hypothesis was that both plots would take the shape of a $1/x^2$ plot which is exactly what we see from \ref{fig:fig 4} and \ref{fig:fig 5} so this result does agree with our hypothesis. 
\textbf{Here I will talk about whether I expect M33 to be bound or unbound and if it matches my hypothesis.}

\textbf{Whether M33 is boand or not plays into the missing satellites problem, I will talk about that and how result of M33's bound/unbound state plays into this problem for the merged remanent.}
